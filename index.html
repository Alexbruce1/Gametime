        <h1>What is Snake?</h1>
        <p>Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for many platforms. The game was partially known for being on early Nokia cell phones, starting in 1997. There are also over 300 Snake-based games in the iOS App Store.</p>
